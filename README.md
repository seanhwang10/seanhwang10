Hello! I’m Sean, a Signal Integrity Engineer from Korea with a passion for high-speed digital design. Currently at Cisco, I specialize in Signal Integrity (SI) solutions for high-speed protocols, including PCIe, XGMI, USB, DDR, and more, within our AI compute server products (Cisco UCS).

My role involves system-level SI simulations, 3D modeling of vias, connectors, and other components/interconnects using tools like Ansys HFSS/Q3D/SiWave, and Power Delivery Network (PDN) optimization across packages and PCBs. I continuously improve my SI/PI models through lab measurements, utilizing tools such as VNA, TDR, and Oscilloscopes for accurate SI lab correlation. Additionally, I automate simulations and data analysis using Python and MATLAB, enhancing efficiency and precision in my work through custom scripts.

With a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering and a Master’s in Computer Engineering from Purdue (go boilers!), along with 3+ years of industry experience, I have a deep understanding of transmission line theories, electromagnetics, and noise mitigation techniques across various signaling standards like PCIe, DDR, and various SerDes. My expertise also extends to PDN evaluation and system-level timing and loss budgets, enabling me to optimize package, PCB, ASIC, and mixed-signal circuits with various cross-functional teams.

I’m so in love with the collaborative spirit of Silicon Valley, where teamwork and innovation push the boundaries of technology and I LEARN EVERY SINGLE DAY. Fellow professionals and enthusiasts, let’s connect to exchange insights on signal integrity, do a deep dive session on Python scripting for SI/PI, or explore the broader tech landscape together! I look forward to engaging with you all.
